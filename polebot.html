I have worked in all aspects of this projects, ranging from troubleshooting hardware problems with our servo motors, to mechanical design of our module locking system, to the code that runs the robot.

<span class="removed">Code</span>
The code is currently being run in MATLAB, however I hope to move it to C++, or have it generated through SIMULINK once the vision is completed. 
<br>

<span class="removed">Vision</span>
One of the more complex problems I have been working on has been integrating computer vision into our current system. We have refined the pole detection to the point where I believe we could move forward with integrating it into a controller. However, I don't believe this is possible given that we are supposed to be working remotely.
