        <p id="section1"> Recycle Rush <br>
            Recycle Rush was the first FRC game I was introduced to. In comparison to the games I've seen since, it's been an outlier for the games FIRST usually puts out, however it game me the opportunity to see a variety of systems nonetheless. I was introduced to the basics of robotics and was heavily involved in the mechanical side of the construction. I was able to learn about different drive trains and wheel types, as we used mecanum wheels that year. I also adapted to work in high-stress situations, as one of the only freshman allowed in to work on the robot at competition. I was also given the task of writing up a packing list, as well as pre- and post- match checklists. This forced me to understand the necessity of planning, and planning for failure. I believe that these lists are one of the more important lessons I took from my freshman year, as I became detail-oreinted and able to identify potential failures of any system.

            I was co-build captain for the 2016 season. I worked closely with the CAD team and our local machinist to get parts made. Additionally, since I was in charge of the largest subteam, I worked each meeting to delegate and supervise the assembly and testing of various subsystems. Like the year prior, I was again responsible for crafting packing and match checklists as well as being in charge of the pit crew for our regional competitions.  
        <p id="section3"> Hiatus <br>
            My junior year, I took a break from FRC. After attending the Championship in 2016, I became interested in pursuing STEM outreach projects, however, my high school team was not. Instead, I mentored an FLL team in the fall, and refereed several events and then competed in the <a href="/ng/">Northrop Grumman HSIC</a> in the spring. 
        <p id="section4"> Power Up <br>
            During my senior year, several other students from the high school team also left, and together we started <a href="http://www.muskwaclub.org/">Team 2710 Jetstream</a>. Due to the small size of the team, I was working even harder this season, plus we all felt like we had something to prove after splitting from the High School team. We were working under serious budget constraints, as most of our funds had gone towards our registration, we were buying discount, used shop equipment and using mostly materials from our Kit of Parts. 
        <p id="section5"> During College <br>
            Even after leaving for college, I have done my best to remain involved in the FIRST community. I help out my old team (2710) during kickoff, since it's so small, and my spring break plans for the past 2 years have revolved around going to volunteer at an FRC competition (and sightseeing in our down time).
