            Recycle Rush was the first FRC game I was introduced to. In comparison to the games I've seen since, it's been an outlier for the games FIRST usually puts out, however it game me the opportunity to see a variety of systems nonetheless. I was introduced to the basics of robotics and was heavily involved in the mechanical side of the construction. I was able to learn about different drive trains and wheel types, as we used mecanum wheels that year. I also adapted to work in high-stress situations, as one of the only freshman allowed in to work on the robot at competition. I was also given the task of writing up a packing list, as well as pre- and post- match checklists. This forced me to understand the necessity of planning, and planning for failure. I believe that these lists are one of the more important lessons I took from my freshman year, as I became detail-oreinted and able to identify potential failures of any system.

            I was co-build captain for the 2016 season. I worked closely with the CAD team and our local machinist to get parts made. Additionally, since I was in charge of the largest subteam, I worked each meeting to delegate and supervise the assembly and testing of various subsystems. Like the year prior, I was again responsible for crafting packing and match checklists as well as being in charge of the pit crew for our regional competitions. 
        <p id="section3"> Hiatus <br>
            My junior year, I took a break from FRC. After attending the Championship in 2016, I became interested in pursuing STEM outreach projects, however, my high school team was not. Instead, I mentored an FLL team in the fall, and refereed several events and then competed in the <a href="/ng/">Northrop Grumman HSIC</a> in the spring.

            During my senior year, several other students from the high school team also left, and together we started <a href="http://www.muskwaclub.org/">Team 2710 Jetstream</a>. 
        <p id="section4"> During College <br>
            Even after leaving for college, I have done my best to remain involved in the FIRST community. I help out my old team (2710) during kickoff, since it's so small, and my spring break plans for the past 2 years have revolved around going to volunteer at an FRC competition (and sightseeing in our down time).
