            I was co-build captain for the 2016 season. I worked closely with the CAD team and our local machinist to get parts made. Additionally, since I was in charge of the largest subteam, I worked each meeting to delegate and supervise the assembly and testing of various subsystems. 
        <h2 id="section3"> Hiatus </h2><br>
            My junior year, I took a break from FRC. After attending the Championship in 2016, I became interested in pursuing STEM outreach projects, however, my high school team was not. Instead, I mentored an FLL team in the fall, refereeing several events and then competed in the <a href="/ng/">Northrop Grumman HSIC</a> in the spring.

            During my senior year, several other students from the high school team also left, and together we started <a href="http://www.muskwaclub.org/">Team 2710 Jetstream</a>.
