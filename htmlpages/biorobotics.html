<h2><small>Building Robots of All Sizes</small></h2>

I have been working in the Biorobotics Lab at CMU since Spring 2019, and my work has focused on 2 main projects: the DARPA SubT Challenge and a Modular Pole Climbing Robot. Each of these projects operate on very different scales, and each has given me a chance to work in different areas in robotics.

I have worked in all aspects of this projects, ranging from troubleshooting hardware problems with our servo motors, to
mechanical design of our module locking system, to the code that runs the robot.

The code is currently being run in MATLAB, however I hope to move it to C++, or have it generated through SIMULINK once
the vision is completed.

One of the more complex problems I have been working on has been integrating computer vision into our current system. We
have refined the pole detection to the point where I believe we could move forward with integrating it into a
controller. However, I don't believe this is possible given that we are supposed to be working remotely.
<br>

<span class="removed">Mechanical Design</span><br>
I have done a lot of small design changes to various parts, however one of my original designs is the modular locking
mechanism. The key constraint was that we couldn't add any additional motors to the robot, as we wanted the bot to
remain light, and represent a "minimum viable product" therefore, we only had vertical and rotational movement. The lock
that I designed fit these constraints, and was capable of supporting the robots through a vertical-to-horizontal pipe
transition.

One of the projects I worked on during Summer 2019 was for the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. The goal was to design and
build a robot or several robots capable of autonomously exploring caves and underground urban areas, while collecting
maps and performing artifact detection

My specialty on the project was working on the hardware for our communications system. Each of our robots were supposed
to drop small nodes, each containing a Wi-fi board that could mesh into a growing Wi-fi network as the robot explored
out of line-of-sight.


The first part I worked on was the physical node-dropping subsystem. I became the point-person for the rest of the
undergrads working in the shop when the 2 designers both left for a week. I machined several of the components, and
directed changes to be made when the drawings were found to be incorrect.

I also worked extensively on debugging the electronics. We designed the nodes so that each Wi-fi board had an extension
board that kept it turned off, until it was next to be dropped. This way, we reduced problems with constantly re-meshing
the network with upwards of a dozen nodes. We initially set this up by gating power with magnetic reed switches, but
when they were dropped from the robot, there was a mechanical bounce. Since we were gating power, there was no way to
debounce the signal in code, so I was tasked with coming up with a mechanical way to keep the nodes on. I did this by
putting a large capacitor inline with the power.
