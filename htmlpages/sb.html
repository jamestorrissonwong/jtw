    My experience in scouting was somewhat different from most others' in the US. I began as a Girl Scout in 1st grade, and
    continued through my senior year of high school. However, I joined the Boy Scouts, as a Sea Scout in my freshman year of
    high school. My high school scouting experienced focused on competitions in backpacking, wilderness survival, and
    seamanship. Each of these competitions required a good deal of studying, physical and mental capability, and leadership.
    Additionally, my experiences in scouting inspired my work on a computer science project in college, found <a href="/112/">here</a>.

<h2 id="section1"> Tambu </h2><br>
    Tambu was the first competition of the year -- a backpacking competition held in the fall. I competed in the following events:
    <ul>
    <li>Trail Signs</li>
    <li>Fire and Hatchet</li>
    <li>Orienteering</li>
    <li>Shelter</li>
    </ul>
    However, I also had a decent amount of knowledge of plant ID, first aid, knots and lashing, and wilderness survival basics for a written exam. During my senior year, I took over the training and organization of our troop, working with over 20 scouts to get prepared for all the events, eventually resulting us winning the overall competition -- the first time we had ever done so.

<h2 id="section2"> SW Rendezvous </h2><br>
    I was only able to attend the Southwestern Rendezvous competition once, but it was one of the best events I've ever been to. Even though it was held over Thanksgiving Weekend, pushing myself both physically and mentally in mariner skills at Camp Pendleton was extremely rewarding.

<h2 id="section3"> Scout Field Day </h2><br>
    Scout Field Day was a joint competition between Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts in the local area. Scouts were expected to perform in a variety of wilderness survival skills to try to prove they could survive in the wilderness. Scouts were given various rating in Plant Identification, Fire Starting, Knots, Lashing, and more. There were 4 levels of patches you could earn:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Block E</td>
            <td>Show proficiency as a patrol</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Silver E</td>
            <td>Run a station</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gold E</td>
            <td>Show you can excel by yourself</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Platinum E</td>
            <td>Train and lead a patrol of scouts trying to get their Block E</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    I was able to earn all of my E's during my 4 years of high school, and oversaw training for all Girl Scouts for a year.

<h2 id="section4"> GAM </h2><br>
    GAM, the Gathering of All Mariners, was a local mariner competition. 
    The main events I competed in were:
    <ul>
        <li>Charting/Piloting</li>
        <li>Morse Code</li>
        <li>Marlinspike</li>
    </ul>
    <figure>
        <center><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/gam.JPG" style="width:100%"></center>
    </figure>
    I always enjoyed GAM a lot, since Tambu mainly focused on basic wilderness survival skills, which can more or less be reduced to some procedures plus common sense. Mariner competitions, however, often tested skills you would never learn outside that context. I served on the student-led planning committee for several years, eventually serving as co-president my senior year. Serving on committee was incredibly rewarding, as you got to plan out the weekend, when boat races would be held, how to plan around the weather for sailing events, and how to improve the training resources provided to every troop.

<h2 id="section5"> AMR </h2><br>
    The Ancient Mariner's Regatta was held over Memorial Weekend every year, and since it was held in San Francisco, we always had smaller crews compared to GAM and Tambu. This meant that everyone competed in more events, which I was perfectly happy with. 
    Some of my favorite events were:
    <ul>
        <li>Charting/Piloting</li>
        <li>Drill</li>
        <li>Pulling Boat/Flotilla Drill</li>
    </ul>
    Other competitions were often based on individual performance, but many of the events at AMR, like<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4QI3YjJjiM">scuttlebutt</a>, <a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L313sZDRbQc">breeches buoy</a>, and pulling boat taught teamwork,
    leadership, and followship skills. AMR was always my favorite event, since you had to work as a tight-knit group in order to do well. Everyone going was willing to put in the time and effort to compete in this event, when most of my peers were more concerened about their grades. Now that I'm in college, I return to the regatta to judge various events, but mainly drill.
