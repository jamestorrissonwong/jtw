    My experience in scouting was somewhat different from most others' in the US. I began as a Girl Scout in 1st grade, and
    continued through my senior year of high school. However, I joined the Boy Scouts, as a Sea Scout in my freshman year of
    high school. My high school scouting experienced focused on competitions in backpacking, wilderness survival, and
    seamanship. Each of these competitions required a good deal of studying, physical and mental capability, and leadership.
    <br>
<h2 id="section1"> Tambu </h2><br>
    Tambu was the first competition of the year -- a backpacking competition held in the fall. I competed in the following events:
    <ul>
    <li>Trail Signs</li>
    <li>Fire and Hatchet</li>
    <li>Orienteering</li>
    <li>Shelter</li>
    </ul>
    However, I also had a decent amount of knowledge of plant ID, first aid, knots and lashing, and wilderness survival basics for a written exam. 
<h2 id="section2"> SW Rendezvous </h2><br>
    I was only able to attend the Southwestern Rendezvous competition once, but it was one of the best events I've ever been to. Even though it was held over Thanksgiving Weekend, pushing myself both physically and mentally in mariner skills at Camp Pendleton was extremely rewarding.

<h2 id="section3"> Scout Field Day </h2><br>
    Scout Field Day was a joint competition between Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts in the local area. Scouts were expected to perform in a variety of wilderness survival skills to try to prove they could survive in the wilderness. Scouts were given various rating in Plant Identification, Fire Starting, Knots, Lashing, and more. There were 4 levels of patches you could earn:
    <table>
        <tr>
            <td>Block E</td>
            <td>Show proficiency as a patrol</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Silver E</td>
            <td>Run a station</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Gold E</td>
            <td>Show you can excel by yourself</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Platinum E</td>
            <td>Train and lead a patrol of scouts trying to get their Block E</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    I was able to earn all of my E's during my 4 years of high school, and oversaw training for all Girl Scouts for a year. 
<h2 id="section4"> GAM </h2><br>
    GAM, the Gathering of All Mariners, was a local mariner competition. 
    The main events I competed in were:
    <ul>
        <li>Charting/Piloting</li>
        <li>Morse Code</li>
        <li>Marlinspike</li>
    </ul>
<h2 id="section5"> AMR </h2><br>
    The Ancient Mariner's Regatta was held over Memorial Weekend every year, and since it was held in San Francisco, we always had smaller crews compared to GAM and Tambu. This meant that everyone competed in more events, which I was perfectly happy with. 
    Some of my favorite events were:
    <ul>
        <li>Charting/Piloting</li>
        <li>Drill</li>
        <li>Pulling Boat/Flotilla Drill</li>
    </ul>
