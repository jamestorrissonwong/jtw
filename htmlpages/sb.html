My experience in scouting was somewhat different from most others' in the US. I began as a Girl Scout in 1st grade, and continued through my senior year of high school. However, I joined the Boy Scouts, as a Sea Scout in my freshman year of high school. My high school scouting experienced focused on competitions in backpacking, wilderness survival, and seamanship. Each of these competitions required a good deal of studying, physical and mental capability, and leadership. They are all described below: <br>
