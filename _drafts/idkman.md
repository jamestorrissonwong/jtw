Discrimination is an interesting beast. 

It's thinking about how different everything would be if you weren't born *like this*

It's this incredible underlying uncertainty, insecurity. Is there something really wrong with me? Are my failures my own? Or are they at the hands of something else that I can't see? 

It's selfish. 

After years of considering my relationship with my father "incredibly poor" at best and "borderline abusive" at worst, there are now many days when I'd prefer to be with him as opposed to my mother. But here's the thing: my mom is so out of touch with everything, it makes everything near impossible. My dad uses my pronouns, he's worked everything out with the rest of his side of the family too. My mom is still a toss-up. She'll slip up sure, but she will also consciously use the wrong pronouns when talking to her friends.
