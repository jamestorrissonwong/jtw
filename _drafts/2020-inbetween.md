title: The In Between
---

I was diagnosed with Asperger's, but it feels like that state of mind is a relic of my past. 

I am a trans man, but I'm lucky, I'm not a trans woman, and I pass with relative ease. 

I am half Chinese, half Japanese, I get confused with the other Asian cadet at Pitt, but I can live at CMU in the relative majority. 

I don't dare make a claim to mental illness, as I've never had a proper diagnosis. 

I grew up living frugally, but never bordering poverty. 

I am relegated to the in-between. 

I get to taste pain, without being irreparably consumed by it. 

Is my voice one that needs to be heard? Deserves to be? 

Words carry weight, and I can't shake the feeling that mine a carry the weight of a single drop in the ocean.
