<!--In this day and age, it is common for high school students to rattle off a laundry list of volunteering activities, clubs, and projects they've led. It's expected, the norm, for almost anyone hoping to get into college. It's so common, that schools and towns have clubs dedicated to volunteering, often organized as a single chapter of a larger national organization. 

It was so easy to fall into the routine of it all. For every honors society, you need to do 2 hours of volunteering a month, usually grading papers. Set aside an hour or two a week after school to help your favorite teacher. Show up to the hospital once a week for 2 hours, and help with discharges and internal deliveries. The local elementary school is having a large event, and they just need people to show up to help. 

While I don't deny the inherent good that stems from the amount individuals are volunteering, I believe the structure has led to a diluted, almost distant type of service. Moreover, it is much more common for society to give in to these organized service efforts,  *finish me*-->

I miss reading books, they generate so much to simply think about (good ones at least). 

It only took me 15 pages of reading *Little Fires Everywhere* to be hit with a wave of familiarity. Maybe it was a combination of skimming through my high school yearbook, or the obtuse standards of Shaker Heights that had me drawing parallels between the two. In the neighborhood next to mine, you could find similar laws to those in Shaker Heights -- no garbage cans on the sidewalks, no sidewalks or stop lights since they're unsightly, and of course 3 or 4 car garages. Shaker Heights revolves around this notion that things should be planned, and presented to the outside world as perfect. It seems like a perfect mirror to the town I grew up in. 

For the high schoolers planning on attending college (which was nearly all of them), their path was set. They would take honors classes, APs, play a sport, take 4 years of a language, volunteer with Los Hermanos, Las Hermanas, Los Ninos, Los Compadres (or one of the other volunteering groups that wasn't in Spanish), eventually join CSF, NHS, and if they had stuck with Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts, get their Eagle or Gold, respectively. Eventually they'd get into one of the UC's, Stanford, one of the Ivy's, or a private school on the East Coast. Even the most average of students (relative to their peers) were attending Cal Poly, or UCSB. Pushing against this structure was like an unspoken taboo, an immovable object, where if you pushed against the mold, it would push back, with equal and opposite force. 

In Girl Scouts, in my troop, once you hit 10th grade, they would start applying pressure for you to do a Gold Award. They had their own internal workshops, a troop leader dedicated to getting your child a Silver or Gold Award, everything streamlined to an almost mechanical process. Of course, these high numbers of Gold Awardees led to a great pitch for leaders to sell the troop to local moms, one to rival even the most egregious weight loss ads -- "You won't believe how easy it is to get a Gold Award -- in 3 EASY steps!"  

Girl Scouts, was where I tried (and unfortunately failed) to break the status quo. In high school, scouting transformed for me. It was no longer about arts and crafts for a few hours after school, or getting patches, or selling cookies. My life revolved around backpacking, outdoor survival skills, sailing skills, ropework. I loved learning knots, lashing, how to chart a course, morse code, and teaching those skills to other scouts. These skills have persisted with me in a way no badges ever would. Of course, I was eventually approached about what I was doing for my Gold Award. 

I didn't want to do a Gold Award. There was so much form to it, you must complete X hours of planning with Y total hours but no more than Z hours of...
I wasn't interested in doing the paperwork. I did want to do my own project, however on my own terms. Growing up with engineers for parents gave me the access and ability to learn STEM from a young age, and I wanted to bring the wonder I found in science to elementary school students. I mocked up several lesson plans, threw together a powerpoint and a pitch,then called up several local elementary schools. 

"Hello? Yes, you'd like to do some lessons on science and engineering? Little labs and things like that? Ok, well are you doing this for a Gold Award? No? Well this might be difficult then..." 

I watched my friends in scouting get easy, positive reception as they worked on their Gold Awards. Yes, of course you could come in to have a lesson with the kids for a Gold Award. A new mural for the school? And a talking about what it means with the students? A great idea. 

On the surface, what I was doing was no different from what my peers were doing. An hour lesson, with a hands on activity, maybe once a month during a semester. And yet, the fact that I wasn't doing a Gold Award gave my project a stigma. Even the schools were caught up in this system, where individuals doing Eagle Scouts Projects or Gold Awards were giving first class privileges. I couldn't contribute to the statistics, I didn't advance the narrative of what the ideal student should be doing, the project should have been under the banner of Girl Scouts. After reaching out to multiple elementary schools, I was only able to give 2 lessons at a single school.
