I've heard from my friends that when you apply for a security clearance, you're supposed to give some references of people who have known you for at least 10 years. That got me thinking about who I've known for that long, the real constants in my life. I changed friend groups a lot, from my parents' disapproval at making friends with boys, to the explorations of different groups trying to figure out my own identity. However, I always kept this voice in the back of my head. I thought it had gone away, but I suppose it was just on a break. I truly don't know if I'll be at peace with my mind.
