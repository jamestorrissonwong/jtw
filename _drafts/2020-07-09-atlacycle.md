This is what you get when you watch Avatar and read Just Mercy at the same time. 

## <small>Part 1 - The Cycle of War</small>

Like most other TV shows, I was late to watching Avatar the Last Airbender -- 15 years late. However, watching it as a full-grown 20 year old gave me a lot of insight into some of the finer points I might have missed otherwise, not to mention access to a wide array of analyses of Avatar's worldbuilding and themes. I was listening to one such analysis detailing the cycle of war. The basics are: Loss becomes anger, anger becomes vengeance, and vengeance becomes loss.[^1] 

Avatar explores this cycle, the notion of venegence, through a multitude of characters. Two of the most prominent examples are shown with Jet, focusing on his appearance in the first season, and Katara's arc during The Southern Raiders. In the first case, we see venegence fully unleashed, where Jet is ready and willing to destroy an entire village to get rid of the Fire Nation soldiers that have occupied it. With Katara, when confronted with the man who killed her mother, she is merciful, electing to not kill him in turn. 

As I've been reading Just Mercy concurrently, I decided to draw some parallels. 



## <small>Incoherent Thoughts</small>

tldr why do we think cartoon characters can have redemption arcs but not real people

like wait this is a real question

## <small>Part 2 - We All Just Need an Iroh</small>

Avatar is also widely known to have one of the best redemption arcs of all time. We get a chance to explore moral gray zones, the effect of trauma, and the importance of support networks with Zuko.
