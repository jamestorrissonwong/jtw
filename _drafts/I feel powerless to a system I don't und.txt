I feel powerless to a system I don't understand

I want to have faith in the power of the meritocracy, but I find that faith slipping from me again and again. I feel like I don't have control in my life, no matter how hard I try. I was born into a body that wasn't mine, a name that wasn't mine, and told to make my own. It's a world where everyone else can walk normally in their own skin, if not liking it, at least understanding that it is theirs. It's like having clothes that don't fit right, but even the best tailors in the world can't quite make it look right. 

I live in a world where trans people are twice as likely to be unemployed, where over half the states do not have law prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity. I want to believe that the wotk I plan to pursue -- in engineering, not a minimum wage job is above that -- but I'm not sure. 

There might simply be some underlying bias that nobody admits to. The same one that had my mom agree to letting me start hormones, all while misgendering and deadnaming me on the phone, so she's spared the embarrassment of explaining how I'm trans to her friends.
