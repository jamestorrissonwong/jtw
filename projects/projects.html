<button class="collapsible">New Buggy 2021(?)</button>
<div class="collapsiblecontent">
    This summer, I started working on the CAD for our buggy for Raceday 2021. One of my main goals was making a more flexible CAD. In the past, CAD has just been handed down from head mechanic to head mechanic, accumulating random planes, sketches, and errors along the way. I took my time redoing the CAD from the ground up, building in as much flexibility to the design with variables, as I wasn't able to be in person to get measurements from our driver. <br><br>

    One of the key things I made sure I did was really get into the details with making our steering as optimatl as theoretically possible. I took a lot of time making sure that we had the proper alignment for Ackermann steering. Moreover, I took the time to write up as much documentation as I could about the new design choices I was making, as well as digging around to explain why we have designed things a certain way in the past. <br><br>

<button class="collapsible">Stress Analysis Crane Project</button>
<div class="collapsiblecontent">
    The purpose of this project was originally to design a crane structure that could support holding up a weight with minimal deflection. 
    The field is shown here:<br><br>

    The structure would need to be attached at the lower right corner, then pass        through the small hole in the wall in order to reach the weight.
    Additionally, there were constraints to the weight of the crane, and the entire         thing had to be made of aluminum. <br><br>

<button class="collapsible">Build18 Hackathon</button>
<div class="collapsiblecontent">
    I was part of a team of 5, competing in the annual Build18 Hackathon, which took place over the first 5 days of the spring semester. We decided to build a robot, which could perform CPR -- chest compressions and rescue breaths, all to the tune of "Stayin Alive"<br><br>

    We had quite a few interesting roadbumps -- many of them tied to our cheap audio        electronics not working with the arduino. Others involved scrounging around for a   transistor in order to gate power from a car battery we were using to run a      solenoid, which we needed to experiment with in order to set up the pneumatics      properly, since it didn't come with any documentation.<br><br>

    However, we ended up winning both the MSA Safety Awards, as well as the Faculty/Staff Choice Award. <br><br>

<button class="collapsible">Gadgetry Final: An Assisted Devices Project</button>
<div class="collapsiblecontent">
    The purpose of this project was originally to design, build and test an assisted device as a group of 4. <br><br>
        
    <blockquote>
    "Our project aims to automate the bottle-opening process, allowing anyone to open a bottle with a twist off lid regardless of their finger strength and dexterity. Overall once the bottle is in place the machine will lower down onto the lid and then twist it off, stopping once the bottle is removed or it has fully retracted. The project will be successful if we are able to autonomously remove a bottle cap off at least 3 styles of bottles."
    <cite>Project Proposal</cite>
    </blockquote>
    <br><br>
   I was in charge of managing the group, ensuring deadlines were met, as well as doing all of the electronics for the project, including choosing motors and sensors. <br><br>
