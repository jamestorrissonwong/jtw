Summer 2020 was a particularly interesting time. During quarantine, I decided to use my time to work on a wide array of smaller projects. <br>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>In Progress</th>
        <th>Completed</th>
        <th>Want to Do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>designing a buggy for Raceday 2021</td>
        <td><a href="/comprepair/">fixing my old computer</a></td>
        <td>hosting this website on a Raspberry Pi (instead of Github)</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><a href="/macbook/">turning an old laptop into an external monitor</a></td>
        <td>building a keyboard</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
        <td>reading up on file systems, ladder logic, and pcb design</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
