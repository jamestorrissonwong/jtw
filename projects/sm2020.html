Summer 2020 was a particularly interesting time. During quarantine, I decided to use my time to work on a wide array of smaller projects. <br>
<br>

This summer certainly wasn't optimal, but I was able to dive into some of the more obscure projects I didn't think I would start. For one, I was able to get this website up and running, and in the process, get significantly more comfortable with git before needing to use it for classes this fall. I also spent a significant amount of time working on documentation, for both buggy and my classes. I enjoyed making concise notes, and reinforcing the concepts I learned. Additionally, I think that while our construction documentation is fairly good, there are few resources for the design process. Hopefully, my work will make it easier for future mechanics designing buggies. I was also able to really extend my breadth of knowledge, looking into more electronics hardware. Not all my projects went according to plan either, I ended up destroying a chip on one of the boards I was trying to make modifications to, but it also gives me the opportunity to design my own board in the future.
