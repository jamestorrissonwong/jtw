title: Northrop Grumman High School Innovation Challenge
---

During my year off from the FIRST Robotics Competition, I instead participated in the Northrop Grumman High School Innovation Challenge. 

The challenge was to design a device that could fit into a 6"x6"x6" space that, when deployed, would block as much light from a source 6.5' above it.

While we explored several mechanical options, such as expanding tape measures, we eventually decided to make a mylar pouch, that was inflated using the motor from an inflatable bed pump.
