I was part of a team of 5, competing in the annual Build18 Hackathon, which took place over the first 5 days of the spring semester. We decided to build a robot, which could perform CPR -- chest compressions and rescue breaths, all to the tune of "Stayin Alive"

We had quite a few interesting roadbumps -- many of them tied to our cheap audio electronics not working with the arduino. Others involved scrounging around for a transistor in order to gate power from a car battery we were using to run a solenoid, which we needed to experiment with in order to set up the pneumatics properly, since it didn't come with any documentation.

However, we ended up winning both the MSA Safety Awards, as well as the Faculty/Staff Choice Award.
