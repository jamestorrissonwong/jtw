Summer 2020 was a particularly interesting time. During quarantine, I decided to use my time to work on a wide array of smaller projects. 

Currently in Progress:
- [ ] designing a buggy for Raceday 2021
- [ ] turning an old laptop into an external monitor
- [ ] reading up on file systems, ladder logic, and pcb design
- [ ] building a keyboard
- [ ] making typeset reference sheets for some of my classes

Would like to get to:
- [ ] hosting this website on a Raspberry Pi (instead of Github)

Completed:
- [ ] fixing my old computer
