This summer, I started working on the CAD for our buggy for Raceday 2021. One of my main goals was making a more flexible CAD. In the past, CAD has just been handed down from head mechanic to head mechanic, accumulating random planes, sketches, and errors along the way. I took my time redoing the CAD from the ground up, building in as much flexibility to the design with variables, as I wasn't able to be in person to get measurements from our driver. 

One of the key things I made sure I did was really get into the details with making our steering as optimatl as theoretically possible. I took a lot of time making sure that we had the proper alignment for Ackermann steering. Moreover, I took the time to write up as much documentation as I could about the new design choices I was making, as well as digging around to explain why we have designed things a certain way in the past.
