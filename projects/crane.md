title: Stress Analysis Crane
---



The purpose of this project was originally to design a crane structure that could support holding up a weight with minimal deflection. 
The field is shown here:

The structure would need to be attached at the lower right corner, then pass through the small hole in the wall in order to reach the weight.
Additionally, there were constraints to the weight of the crane, and the entire thing had to be made of aluminum.
