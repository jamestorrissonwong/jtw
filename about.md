### James Wong

When getting some inital feedback on my website, I was asked why I had "mechanical engineer +" under my name. Why a plus? Well, I think it speaks to the breadth of my interests and passions. I'm a Junior in Mechanical Engineering. PLUS I'm pursuing coursework in Cybersecurity and International Conflict as well as Computer Science. PLUS I work with robots. And rockets. And buggies. And hopefully more fields I haven't even discovered yet. Plus, did I mention it looks cool?

### Who is he really?

I'm a trans man, with a a wide array of skills, ranging from wilderness survival skills, to CAD and soldering. While I hope to join the Air Force, current medical policy prohibits me from doing so -- but I'm still doing my best to get a medical waiver. I like writing about my experiences as a trans man, about books, and as a way to reflect on my experiences. However, I'm most at peace when hiking, building Legos, or getting absorbed in music. <br>
