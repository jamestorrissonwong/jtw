### Who is he really?

I'm a trans man, with a a wide array of skills, ranging from wilderness survival skills, to CAD and soldering. While I hope to join the Air Force, current medical policy prohibits me from doing so -- but I'm still doing my best to get a medical waiver. I like writing about my experiences as a trans man, about books, and as a way to reflect on my experiences. However, I'm most at peace when hiking, building Legos, or getting absorbed in music. <br>
