title: Automated Bottle Opener

## <small>An Assisted Devices Project</small>

The purpose of this project was originally to design, build and test an assisted device as a group of 4. 

 >"Our project aims to automate the bottle-opening process, allowing anyone to open a bottle with a twist off lid regardless of their finger strength and dexterity. Overall once the bottle is in place the machine will lower down onto the lid and then twist it off, stopping once the bottle is removed or it has fully retracted. The project will be successful if we are able to autonomously remove a bottle cap off at least 3 styles of bottles."

I was in charge of managing the group, ensuring deadlines were met, as well as doing all of the electronics for the project, including choosing motors and sensors.
