The theme for Carnival 2019 was "Planet Earth". I initially came to Fringe primarily wanting to participate in Buggy, but over the year, I got heavily involved in booth as well.

Our booth was based on Disney's "Lilo and Stitch". Leading up to building the booth, I was involved with building wall, floor, and roof frames and occassionally helping with crafts. 



The first day or two were hectic, trying to get the floor leveled, and the walls up.

Eventually, once the walls were up, the roof was ready to go on. Elly and I were sitting on the wall frames, screwing in the roof panels as they were passed up to us. However, about halfway through screwing them in, it started to pour -- a torrential pour. 


Once we got the roof on though, my grit was really tested by my next task -- wiring the booth. Each booth was wired up with electrical outlets and lightbulbs, but they needed to be made up to housing standards. It was my first time wiring something in this fashion and it took me several attempts to get it right before we were cleared by the inspectors. 



We went on to win People's Choice Booth, and 3rd place in the Independent Organization category
