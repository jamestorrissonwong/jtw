Taking computer science courses have taught me many things. Sure, they taught me about data structures, about parallelism, abstraction and polymorphism. But more practically, they taught me that you should always test your programs, make sure they run as expected. And not just on simple cases either. You needed diverse test cases. You needed to test on edge cases.

I’ve had the misfortune of seeing these faulty systems creep into systems outside of computer programs, because I am an edge case. So many of the systems in place today are fundamentally flawed, and upon needing to work with a transgender person, break down to a unusable state.

Let’s take for instance, my credit history. My mom made sure that I had a credit card towards the end of high school. I didn’t buy things recklessly, it was just in place to start helping me build credit. The summer between high school and college, I got my name legally changed. I took care of all the paperwork, squared everything away with the courts and the Social Security department, and thought I would be fine. A year into college, I decided I should apply for my own credit card and work towards being more independent. However, my application was quickly, succinctly, rejected. A few online credit checks later, it was painfully clear that under “Victoria Wong” I had a credit score of 780, yet under “James Wong,” there was no history at all. Despite having the same social security number, none of my credit had transferred. 

Alright, so we’ve found a fundamental discontinuity in terms of credit. However, credit score isn’t necessarily tied to a government agency, surely things must be more coherent within the government, right?

I recently received a letter in the mail from the Selective Service. Inside, they had “identified me as a man who is potentially required to sign up.” On the attached form, they listed the exceptions: Anyone over 26, those who are physically incapacitated, those currently serving, and, you guessed it, transgender individuals. Surely, there are records that detail that I got my gender marked changed on my birth certificate. One would think that this information would be passed on to other departments which might need this information, for example the Selective Service. It truly felt like a slap to the face, as I have been continually medically disqualified from ROTC, and now I was receiving a letter asking that I be available to join the armed forces. Now this would normally be harmless, until you take into consideration that being registered for the draft can be a requirement for obtaining a job with certain companies or government departments. So, while all of the cisgender boys were being directed to sign up for the draft at school, or through the DMV, I was given no direction or guidance on how to approach my registration. 

These are just two of my personal examples, and I have many more (CMU housing I’m looking at you) of where our society, our government, and our schools are failing many of its citizens, perhaps without even realizing it. It’s time for these institutions to start reforming their systems to take into account a more diverse set of people. Times have changed, and so too must these specifications on these systems. However, it’s yet to be determined whether or not they will step up to handle exceptions, such as myself.
