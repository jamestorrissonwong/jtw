I was recently asked in an application for an award, what I thought my proudest achievement was. The following is my complicated, but concise answer.

My biggest personal achievement isn’t a tangible award, nor is it static – it’s continually evolving and changing meaning. My proudest achievement is continuing to pursue a medical waiver for Air Force ROTC. I’m a transgender man who started taking hormones in December 2017, which according to the military’s medical policy, makes me medically disqualified for service. Two years ago, when I first talked to the commander of Detachment 730, she told me that the path forward would be difficult. 

Since I first joined the wing, I have been removed from the program twice due to my medicals, but I’m still pushing forward to rejoin Air Force ROTC. For many college students, the prospect of waking up at 5 AM three to four times a week is reason enough to quit ROTC. For others it’s how your commitment to ROTC will make your social life and academics suffer, but despite all those sacrifices on top of the uncertainty that my medical waivers will go through, I’m still persistent. 

Currently, I’m applying for an exception to policy waiver, which can only be approved by the Secretary of the Air Force. There are days when I believe that getting that waiver signed will be impossible, that I will never be good enough and I should cut my losses, but I always convince myself that this fight is worth it. I feel a duty to my country, and the transgender community, and my biggest achievement is being uncompromising in fighting for both.
