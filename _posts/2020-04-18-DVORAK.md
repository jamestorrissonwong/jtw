Ok. So I'm trying to learn to type. Of course I can type on a normal keyboard, but now I'm hoping to pick up dvorak. It's slow going right now, but hopefully I can get faster quickly. I'm still instinctively reaching for certain letters. Plus I'm finding it significantly easier to type with my left hand. I haven't gotten used to having "I" not on one of the keys my fingers normally rest on. I'm also getting confused by where the "T" is. Not to mention the quotations and period and comma are all in the top left corner. I also seem to be much better at typing with my left hand than my right. Hopefully I get time to practice more over the coming weeks.
