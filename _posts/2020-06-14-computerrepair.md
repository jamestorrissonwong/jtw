I first built a computer with my dad in 8th grade. Now, its over 6 years old and still going strong (unlike my of my laptops). Over the years I've put in incremental upgrades to keep it running. In 2018, I had a hard drive failure, and had to install a new one, albeit much smaller than the original 2TB one I installed originally. Over winter break in 2019, This hard drive was also running out of space and my mom wanted to use it for work while I was away at college. Between SSDs getting cheaper and me having more disposable income, I bought a new SSD, which would hopefully mitigate the losses from another hard drive failure. I was able to successfully add a second disk to the PC. 

More recently I've added some quality of life features to my computer. I found I was out of SATA cables, as one I had tried to use was broken, so I salvaged the one from the optical drive in order to install the new SSD. However, I wanted to get the disc drive running again in case my mom needed to use it. This turned out to be very handy when I bought a new Wi-Fi card. Since I first built the computer, I had been using an external USB-based Wi-Fi card, however they seemed to fail every few years. So, I decided to bite the bullet since I seemed to have the PCIe slot for it -- and it turned out to be much less expensive than I originally thought. I found I needed to install the drivers for it on a disk though (since you wouldn't have internet when trying to install it). And so the optical drive proves its usefulness, I suppose. Another nice addition is that the Wi-Fi card also comes with Bluetooth support, which was absent before.
