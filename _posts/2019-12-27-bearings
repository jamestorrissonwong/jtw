I'm anchored at home, captain of my mind. My sense of direction in my home turf is finely tuned. In Pittsburgh though, my senses aren't as sharp.   

In Los Angeles, North and South feel different to me. They're the two halves of my mind. Opposing halves. 

The North is my pragmatic side, cold, harsh, and orderly. The mountains rise up beyond the skyline, each peak a new challenge to summit. Planes in front of them, all in a perfect line descending from the heavens, remind me of the strict expectations of adulthood. 

The South is optimistic, romantic. The view is harder to find for me, but its worth the trek. Beaches, endless ocean trailing off to San Diego and memories of long, reckless nights. Where my friends and I took to the city with abandon, driving through the gridded streets in my old Honda Civic. 

The North is my future and the South is my past. They're my cardinal directions and I've used them to chart my course through life. But now I'm in foreign waters, looking for new markers to get my bearings.
