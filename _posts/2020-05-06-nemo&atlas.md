Nemo
: in Latin: nobody
: in Oromo: man
: in literature: Captain of the Nautilus

I used to take comfort in feeling small, insignificant, a nobody. It calmed me, knowing that most of my mistakes I was worried about would only hurt me, and wouldn't affect others, or even really matter in the grand scheme of things. I was free, only responsible for me and those close to me. 

Recently, I have felt quite different. I feel like I have to be somebody and nobody all at once. 
My mistakes are more than me. To most people, I am nobody. But to a select few, I am everybody.

Atlas
: in mythology: the Titan tasked with holding up the world
: common use: a book of maps

In April 2019, Map Pesqueira became the face of the transgender military ban. He's another student my age, attending school in Texas, who lost his Army ROTC scholarship. I saw it happen, spreading across Google for a week or two, during my compulsive searches for "Trans military ban" between classes. As my own commander was walking me through the next steps, how we were planning on proceeding with my own case, I was relieved to know I wasn't the only cadet out there trying to find a path forward. I'm lucky to be in a position where I don't need a scholarship, and quickly donated to his GoFundMe. For the first time in a long while, I didn't feel so alone.

At the same time, I looked at all that coverage and wondered what it was like, existing in that media spotlight. I've thought about it -- going more public -- but that's not who I am. I wouldn't go out of my way to be a trans influencer, and while few of my friends know I'm trans, fewer know how I've struggled to pursue ROTC. I'm more content quietly suffering, at least for now, until all of this is actually over. 

When I picked a new name for myself 2 years ago, I asked for suggestions, eventually settling on James. However, there was one other name that stuck out to me -- Atlas. And over my journey with ROTC I've only identified with it more and more. Every week at school, I have felt like I need to carry the weight of the world. I know the only reason I haven't given up on ROTC is because I think I have the best chance of getting a waiver, and that can at least open the door for discussion on the accession for other trans service members. It feels like every B, every week I don't have a breakthrough in my computer vision code, every push-up below the max reflects poorly on not only myself, but the thousands of other trans men and women across the country. It's my responsibility to take the burden for those who can't, to finish school early with a major in mechanical engineering, two minors, robotics research, and as close to a perfect fitness assesment as I can get. And I'll suffer silently.
