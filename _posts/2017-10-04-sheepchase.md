### Alternate Title: The Sheep Man Cometh



He was searching for a sheep in the entirety of Japan, and we were searching for a meaning in a bowl of soup. The goal for the assignment was simple: go to Tsujita, then eat ramen (with the Tsukemen recommended). Yet, there was a hidden complexity: how does one go about eating soup correctly? The same rings true for the protagonist of A Wild Sheep Chase. He has no direction, only a vague understanding of his end goal. He must find a sheep, with only a picture, within two months. Murakami keeps readers on their toes as the mystery of the sheep unfolds. 

One Wednesday, I had skipped school to go to Breaking Down the Walls, then proceeded to avoid my homework by going to Sawtelle. A Peninsula student ditching school and avoiding homework is a rare occurrence, but in the moment, it seemed perfectly mundane. Like myself roaming the West LA streets that afternoon, straying from my diligent work schedule, the protagonist roams Japan, abandoning his home and job. 

Throughout the novel, Murakami plays with the notion of normality. The protagonist is average -- something emphasized throughout the novel -- yet is faced with the abnormal. From anarchist sheep to all-knowing men in suits, ghosts and women with beautiful ears, the protagonist never questions the strange things he encounters, but merely accepts them as fact and moves on. Instead, his long, detailed inner monologues center around the banal -- the pathetic life of an author/historian, the nature of the business across the street from his hotel, whale genitalia hanging on the wall -- and understanding his obscure circumstances is skimmed over. 

> My ex-wife kept precise records about sex. Not that she kept a diary per se. She recorded in a notebook exact data about her periods from her first year on and included sex as a supplementary reference. Altogether there were eight of these notebooks, all kept in a locked drawer together with important papers and photographs.

In a broader sense, Murakami utilizes opposites, continually doing the reverse of what’s expected. From the Junitaki township’s less-than-optimal location and the girlfriend trying to hide her beauty (in the form of ears), to the unnamed protagonist and lack of a satisfactory ending, A Wild Sheep Chase goes against all conventions -- both in its structure and details --  of modern literature and culture. 

Walking through Sawtelle, one can see the stark contrast between Eastern and Western culture. Curry houses, ramen shops, and sushi sit right next to Brian’s Shave Ice. It’s this dichotomy that reminds me -- I’m an American reading a Japanese novel. A Wild Sheep Chase is all about a reversal of a typical plot in western culture. Perhaps it was intentional, or perhaps it was a product of Murakami’s Japanese roots, but either way, the Hero’s Journey -- the story structure omnipresent in western media -- is noticeably absent from Murakami’s novel. 

The Hero’s Journey starts in the normal world with a call to adventure, seen in this story as the Man in the Suit asking the protagonist to find the sheep. From there the hero should enter the unknown and face trials, have an epiphany, complete his quest, and come back to the known world a changed person. Though the protagonist enters the unknown, there are no trials, no death or rebirth, no revelation, not even a meaningful reward at the end of the “adventure.” 

Did I come back from Sawtelle a changed person? No, but the protagonist of A Wild Sheep Chase didn’t change either. There is a paucity of character development, despite it being a timeless staple of any story. The biggest change we see is the protagonist quitting smoking, which is not portrayed as a significant challenge nor does it have a meaningful impact on the story. He starts the book as a lonely, boring individual and he ends the book in the same fashion. The protagonist doesn’t even come close to the typical depiction of a hero. He has no special skills or talents, and no desire to get better. There is nothing to set him apart from the rest of the rabble. If anything, he takes after the passive sheep (or as alluded to in one chapter, Watson from Sherlock Holmes), simply being led to greener pastures, while the magic sheep is a smart, ambitious, cunning -- albeit anarchal -- character. 

>I sat on the sofa reading The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The story began: “My colleague Watson is limited in his thinking to rather narrow confines, but possesses the utmost tenacity.” Not a bad lead-in sentence.

The ramen eating took only a few minutes -- surprising considering Tsujita’s popularity -- and the obvious question was: what now? I found myself asking the same question throughout the novel. The plot merely plods forward -- not to any credit of the main character -- simply due to a series of coincidences. The story of the protagonist is as much an adventure as the trip to Tsujita. There is substance, events occurred, but at the end of the day, what did the characters gain from going on an “adventure” and what does the reader gain from hearing about it?

What made that novel worth reading? Despite how boring the story seems, there was always a desire to keep going. The protagonist doesn’t dwell on the strange occurrences, but that doesn’t stop the reader from thinking about them. Murakami didn’t spoon feed you (neither did this assignment, nor the servers at Tsujita). Needing to think critically -- not just for an assignment -- but to understand the plot itself. Throughout the novel, there were parts that were convoluted, and I needed to consult a friend to discuss developments in the plot, since the narrator was equally clueless as us. 

Once we start looking at the novel one magnitude of storytelling closer, we see more come into focus. In another act of reversal, we see the minor characters are really the biggest players and the major characters could fade into the background. The Rat fits into the typical role of a hero. He finds the sheep, battles (mentally) with the sheep, and makes a heroic sacrifice killing the sheep and himself in the process. The Rat is even reborn as a man in a sheep costume (a reversal from a sheep living in a man), conveniently fitting into the Hero’s Journey mold.

A Wild Sheep Chase seemed more like a mystery novel than an adventure. The bits and fragments of information we got on the history of the sheep and the identity of the Rat were enough to keep the reader’s attention. In this sense, the story is really about the Rat, the Sheep, and the Man in the Suit -- the invisible forces driving the plot forward. The protagonist was just a vessel to hear this story. After all, this is the third novel in “The Rat Trilogy.” It’s as if the real essay was written about me writing this essay, writing about the trip to Sawtelle -- a story twice removed. 

This is a story that doesn’t reveal it’s true hero until the final pages of the book, and like every other revelation, passes over the moment fairly quickly. Then the book, like the trip to Sawtelle and like this essay, simply ends.
