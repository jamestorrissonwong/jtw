Buggy was one of those traditions that drew me to Carnegie Mellon in the first place. And after my first Raceday, I don't know what I would have done with my life in college if I didn't have Carnival. 

The first semester of buggy was a really positive learning experience. Waking up early on the weekend (3:30, 4 AM) for rolls was manageable, especially considering I was up early for ROTC during the week as well. I learned about the basics of carbon fiber wraps and a lot of the general maintenance on buggies.

However, the spring semester was pretty challenging. Each build working on the construction of the new buggy was a long, taxing night of troubleshooting and problem solving. From the outset, we started having problems with our vacuum bags. Each wrap seemed to go fairly poorly, often ending at 1 or 2 AM, because our vacuum wouldn't hit a high enough pressure and was leaking.

However, despite having a lot of problems with the buggy's construction, we were always able to make smaller repair wraps to fix any of the carbon fiber which adhered poorly. We debuted "Blind Faith" for Raceday 2019, winning First Place in the Design Competition.
