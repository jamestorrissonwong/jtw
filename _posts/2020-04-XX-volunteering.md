In this day and age, it is common for high school students to rattle off a laundry list of volunteering activities, clubs, and projects they've led. It's expected, the norm, for almost anyone hoping to get into college. It's so common, that schools and towns have clubs dedicated to volunteering, often organized as a single chapter of a larger national organization. 

It was so easy to fall into the routine of it all. For every honors society, you need to do 2 hours of volunteering a month, usually grading papers. Set aside an hour or two a week after school to help your favorite teacher. Show up to the hospital once a week for 2 hours, and help with discharges and internal deliveries. The local elementary school is having a large event, and they just need people to show up to help. 

While I don't deny the inherent good that stems from the amount individuals are volunteering, I believe the structure has led to a diluted, almost distant type of service. Moreover, it is much more common for society to give in to these organized service efforts,  *finish me*
