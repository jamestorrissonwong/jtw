When we first heard that classes were being moved online due to COVID-19, the immediate reaction from myself and many of my friends in Fringe was "what's going to happen to Carnival?" 

This year was supposed to be the 100th year of Buggy races, and we had built an incredible buggy this year. We were so excited to race. Unfortunately, Carnival was cancelled. Months of hard work wouldn't see the light of Tech & Frew until next year. 

Carnival was supposed to be the culmination of the hours spent ditching lecture to machine brakes, the late nights making the buggy perfect even when I had ROTC in the morning, the paper mache at 1 AM trying to make a pegasus for our booth. 

Of course, they tried to make online Carnival as fun as possible, but nothing can replace the real thing. The feeling of being at Carnival is truly electric, buzzing off of coffee or Red Bull or both. It's the ever-present ache in your feet from building a literal house for 8 hours after class for 5 days, and showing up to class with a hard hat as your badge of honor. 

For me, it even evokes feelings of home. There's the constant light, constant movement, as Midway is never truly deserted that brings me back to the steady glow of LA at night. Plus you get to spend hour after hour, day after day with your framily, those you've worked with all year and the alumni who came before you. 

I suppose I'll have to stay for my Master's to get in just one more.
