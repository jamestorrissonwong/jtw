Compared to last year, this year's buggy build went incredibly smoothly. We started some of the more major builds earlier -- being about halfway done with the entire build at the end of the first semester. We were able to crank through the rest of the build and had a completely functional buggy before Spring Break, excluding purely cosmetic changes. None of the vacuum bag problems seemed to persist, perhaps due to finally cleaning out our vacuum (which is lacking a resin trap).

Unfortunately, Carnival was cancelled, so we were only able to roll our new Buggy once this year. However, the majority of the work on Baltic is complete, letting us plan for building a new buggy for Raceday 2021.
