Most kids coming into ROTC join so they can learn tactics, strategy, and eventually grand strategy. 
However, my experience hasn't been that of most kids. The past 2 years for me have been an excercise in strategy. 

I came out of high school confident, maybe overly so. I had proved I was capable, a stellar student, a multitude of extracurriculars, and I even had a modest social life to boot. I had proven capable of pushing myself to the limits in all that I did and had come out successful. I had shown that I could perform against a conventional enemy -- getting into college. During my first few weeks on campus, I decided to invest myself into ROTC, thinking I would be able to get a waiver against Trump's transgender military ban. 

The US was emboldened after its success following the Gulf War, so much so it ended up waging endless wars, hoping to replicate its success in the Middle East. 

By every metric I was doing well. In my freshman year, I had finished my first semester with an IMT of the Month Award, ranked in the top 1/3 of my flight, and had a 4.0 GPA to boot. That didn't stop the military from disqualifying me. That was expected though, and now I just had to keep up what I was doing as I tried to get a waiver. 

2 years later, and I find myself telling myself the same thing. I'm a good leader, a good student, physically fit. I have all the makings of being successful in this program. I've kept telling myself that, surely, I must be close, that success is just around the corner. Yet, this is the same mindset that has kept America in Afghanistan for nearly 2 decades. 

Tactically, I was able to perform in each of my classes, or any of the other activities I performed. Strategically, I had set up a careful balance of school work, leadership positions, and time for exercise and ROTC. I knew my ways, means, and ends. I thought that was all I needed to be successful, and yet, I think I have been missing one crucial piece. Grades or guns, I outclassed the ROTC requirements as much as America could outgun any terrorist cell. 

America has been waging a war on terrorism -- not a state, but an idea. Perhaps, this is where I deviate from my analogy. I'm finally realizing that I may not be waging a conventional war, that I can't necessarily win this fight through my willpower alone. Going into ROTC, I had faith that logic would prevail and that this decision would be more than petty politics, but after 2 failed Exception to Policy waivers, I'm doubting this assumption. I feel like I'm stuck in a lose-lose situation. If I give up, I prove the administration right, that maybe I'm not strong enough to serve, but if I don't, I may just be fighting a war with no end. 

With all that said, had I picked to fight the wrong war? Had I picked an unwinnable fight? Had I really thought I could brute force my way through a policy that was had undoubtably stemmed from hatred and bigotry? Perhaps, but I still haven't used all the tools at my disposal. I can turn to my allies, find insiders to vouch for me. I'm lucky to have connections to professors, retired officers, and scholars in the intelligence community who believe in what I'm trying to accomplish. This is my pivot, the fundamental change in my strategy.

And if all else fails, I am hoping for a Biden presidency in 2020. It would fundamentally bring back order to the military accesssions process for transgender people -- a *deus ex machina* that unfortunately doesn't exist for the Middle East. All I can hope for is that I have learned from America's mistakes when fighting my own wars.
