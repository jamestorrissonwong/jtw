Just a few days ago, I was shocked to see in the corner of my friend's Snapchats something incredibly mundane -- a pair of earbuds. It occurred to me that I had never seen her ever listening to music. I haven't seen several of my friends with earbuds, really. Nonchalantly, she simply said that she doesn't usually bring her earbuds with her.

To me, the prospect of doing the same was terrifying. For as long as I've had the means to listen to music, I've been tethered to a pair of earbuds. Throughout my childhood, while I was drowning, my music kept me afloat, pulling me back to the surface. When I was with my dad, the spaces between real, human interactions were few and far between. Music would pad the spaces between, making sure I didn't lose my mind, filling anything from the 10 minute car rides between my parent's houses, to the days and weeks of vacations with my dad. 

I couldn't ever talk to my dad, and so naturally my brain became prone to overthinking. The word count that should have been used to talk to people instead manifested itself as conversations with myself. Unfortunately most of them weren't positive. It was difficult coping as I wrestled with all the parts of myself that I despised -- my Aspergers, my gender, a lack of independence. Music was a fixed point on the horizon for when I was seasick, nauseous with a storm of emotions. I could dive into a song, and it turned into a full thinking exercise, demanding all of my attention. It created a protective bubble that none of my malicious thoughts could penetrate, since I was too busy dissecting a song, pulling apart a song carefully. I would inspect each lyric, count through each of the bars, note which words fell on the down beat, listen to and isolate each instrument, try to pick out tiny phrases that would normally go unnoticed. 

This general fear of my thoughts, where my brain might wander if left unchecked, led to every waking moment carefully filled. I kept my brain constantly working -- classes blended into music, blended back into homework. Each night I hoped that I had sufficiently exhausted my mind, so I might slip into an easy sleep. However, now I've instead taken to simply pushing my mind to absolute exhaustion and listening to podcasts as I drift to unconsciousness.

Maybe one day I'll be able to go without filling my days with constant noise. Unfortunately that day is not today.
