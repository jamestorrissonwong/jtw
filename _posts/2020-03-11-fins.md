This year for Carnegie Mellon Rocket Command, our big design choice this year was to move away from fiberglass components and instead use carbon fiber. I suggested we buy prefab airframes, but do a small wrap ourselves to make our fins.

My initial idea was to use a female mold -- something I hadn't yet tried, but was interested in pursuing. However, due to them being hollow we would have had much higher fin flutter than we would have liked.

Instead, we did a standard male mold around a laser-cut wood core. The final product didn't make it on to the rocket due to time constraints, but I hope to make a better set for next year.
