<div class="collapsiblecontent">

    <span class="improved">Course Highlights</span> 
    - Basics of programming, recursion, and dictionaries
    - A final term project
    - Programming skills in Python

    <span class="fixed">Final Project</span> <br>
    The basis for my project was being able to identify various International Code Flags, used in the maritime community for messages and signalling. Typically,decoding these messages requires the use of a large book containing all possible       messages, however I automated this processes using OpenCV and a dictionary of definitions. Additionally, I added some smaller features, such as a way to send       messages to another person using sockets. 


    Some example code from my Term Project:

    {% highlight Python %}

    #converts codes text file to dictionary
    def codes():
        d = {}
        p = path.absPath()
        with open(p + "/allDefs.txt", "rt") as f:
            all = f.read()

        lines = all.split("\n")

        for i in range(len(lines)-1):
            definition = lines[i].split(" ")
            if definition[1] in string.digits:
                d[definition[0] + definition[1]] = listString(definition[2:])
            else:
                d[definition[0]] = listString(definition[1:])

        return d
    {% endhighlight %}
