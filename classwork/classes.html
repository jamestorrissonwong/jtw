        ## <small>15-112</small>


        <span class="improved">Course Highlights</span> 
        - Basics of programming, recursion, and dictionaries
        - A final term project
        - Programming skills in Python

        <span class="fixed">Final Project</span> <br>
        The basis for my project was being able to identify various International Code      Flags, used in the maritime community for messages and signalling. Typically,       decoding these messages requires the use of a large book containing all possible       messages, however I automated this processes using OpenCV and a dictionary of       definitions. Additionally, I added some smaller features, such as a way to send       messages to another person using sockets. 


        Some example code from my Term Project:

        {% highlight Python %}

        #converts codes text file to dictionary
        def codes():
            d = {}
            p = path.absPath()
            with open(p + "/allDefs.txt", "rt") as f:
                all = f.read()

            lines = all.split("\n")

            for i in range(len(lines)-1):
                definition = lines[i].split(" ")
                if definition[1] in string.digits:
                    d[definition[0] + definition[1]] = listString(definition[2:])
                else:
                    d[definition[0]] = listString(definition[1:])

            return d
        {% endhighlight %}
